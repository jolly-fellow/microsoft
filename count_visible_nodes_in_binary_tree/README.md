# Count Visible Nodes in Binary Tree


In a binary tree, if in the path from root to the node A, there is no node with greater value than A’s, this node A is visible. We need to count the number of visible nodes in a binary tree.
```
Example 1:

Input:
        5
     /     \
   3        10
  /  \     /
20   21   1

Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 visible nodes: 5, 20, 21, and 10.

Example 2:

Input:
  -10
	\
	-15
	   \
	   -1

Output: 2
Explanation: Visible nodes are -10 and -1.
```
